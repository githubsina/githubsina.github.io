I am a Third-year Ph.D. student at [Microsystem Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lmis1/) at the Swiss Federal Institute Lausanne [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), jointly enrolled in Swiss Federal Institute ZÃ¼rich [ETHz](https://ethz.ch/en.html). In my research I seek to connect extended reality- and microengineering techniques to students learning and assessments analysis. Also, I am seeking for other field that could inplement deisgn-based method into interdisciplinary field as well. I am supervised by [Prof. Dr. Juergen Brugger](https://people.epfl.ch/juergen.brugger)) and co-supervised by [Prof. Dr. Manu Kapur](https://www.manukapur.com/)). 

Outside of academia, I enjoy photography, snowbording and playing badminton, hiking, and reading.
