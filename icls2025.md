## Abstract
This study explores two major misconnections in cleanroom learning: limited hands-on engagement due to advanced automation and the disconnect between theoretical learning goals and practical learning experiences. When designing inquiry-based activities, teachers usually expect students to achieve several conceptual learning goals. However, when learning to experiment, students often focus on hands-on instructions and are overloaded with procedural information, leaving little capacity to make sense of the action and gain conceptual understanding. We present a mixed reality (MR)-enhanced cleanroom training study aimed at bridging this gap. The extra information and questions visualized by MR bring students’ attention to the conceptual knowledge behind the procedure, reminding them to reflect more on the intention of the activity design. Our thematic analysis showed that students who used MR to assist their experimental learning were able to realize the conceptual learning expectations and think beyond equipment usage.
