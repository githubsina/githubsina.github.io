## MixedLAB: Mixed Reality to Teach Students Experimental Knowledge in Microfabrication

### Qinglan Shan, Julia Chatain, Manu Kapur, JÃ¼rgen Brugger
We are developing a new approach to leverage Mixed Reality (MR) affordances for
teaching microfabrication processes, such as performed in a cleanroom. Our goal is
to design interactive MR content to improve microfabrication and cleanroom training
practices. MR presents a promising avenue as it allows hands-free interaction with the
system and diminishes cognitive load when learning complex content. We incorporate
diverse learning techniques such as real-time feedback, scaffolding, simulations,
inquiries, and multimodal interactions to enhance the efficacy and feasibility of
educational practices in the design of applications. In a course about microfabrication
in bachelor curriculum, we carried out hands-on training sessions in a real cleanroom
environment. By the end of the course, five students completed their experiments. We
observed that MR was effective in customizing learning experiences and increasing
student engagement. Additionally, MR proved helpful for teaching assistants in
clarifying complex concepts and phenomena related to the fabrication tools during
practical sessions. Although the small sample size limits our ability to draw definitive
conclusions, initial qualitative assessments and post-training evaluations suggest that
integrating MR into practical engineering education holds great promise.
